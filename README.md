# Product-based-recommendation-system
A product based recommendation system which uses Machine learning algorithm such as KNN and cosine similarity and also uses MongoDB as a database which stores the user data for a semi-collaborative filtering. 

**Accuracy :** 
>Calculated accuracy using nDCG. 

Some randomly selected product efficiency: 
 1. Batman killer croc takedown figures: nDCG=0.917 

 2. Star Wars Movie Heroes Yoda: nDCG=0.942
 
 3. Harry Potter Hogwarts Bookmarks: nDCG=0.9406 
 
 ## Technology Used in this project: 
 
 1. Pandas 
 2. Numpy 
 3. Sklearn 
 4. MongoDB as Databases  
 5. Streamlit for UI
